📊 Power BI Report: Adventure-Works-Sales-Report
📌 Project Overview

This repository hosts the documentation for a Power BI report published via Power BI Service. The report lets users visually explore [brief description of the dataset, e.g. “company sales over time,” “customer behaviors,” “product performance metrics”].

The key goal is to transform data into an interactive, analytical dashboard that helps stakeholders gain insights through visual exploration.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop / Power BI Service — for building and publishing the interactive report

Data Source(s) — e.g. Excel, CSV, database, APIs (whatever feeds your report)

GitHub — for version control, documentation, and portfolio showcasing

📈 Key Features & Visuals

(Replace these example items with the actual ones from your report)

Trends Over Time — visualize metric growth or decline over months/years

Category Comparisons — compare performance across regions, products, or segments

Interactive Filters / Slicers — filter data by date, category, region, etc.

KPI Cards & Summary Metrics — display totals, averages, growth rates

Drill-down / Hierarchies — navigate from high-level to detailed views

🧠 Findings & Insights

Here you share the most interesting observations and interpretations from your visual analysis. Some possible ideas:

Metric X peaked during [time period]

Region A consistently outperformed Region B in [measure]

Patterns of seasonality or cyclical behavior

Relationships or correlations between different metrics (e.g. price and volume)

🧮 Report Structure & Data

Explain how your report is set up and how data flows through it:

Data preparation / transformation steps (Power Query, M, or DAX)

Key measures / calculated columns (e.g. growth %, moving averages)

Relationships between tables (if you used a data model)

Design decisions (e.g. why certain charts / layouts were chosen)
